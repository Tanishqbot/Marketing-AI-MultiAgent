# Marketing MultiAgent AI

## Overview
The Marketing Multi-Agent System is a collaborative framework designed to streamline and automate complex marketing workflows. Built using Crew AI and integrated with the large language model groq/Ollama 3.1:8b, the system assigns specialized roles to multiple AI agents to manage distinct marketing tasks. The platform is deployed on Streamlit, providing output visualization.

## Features
- **Role-Based Agents**: Each agent is designed with a specific role and backstory to enhance task specialization.
- **Task Automation**: Automates key marketing processes, including content creation, campaign analysis, and trend forecasting.
- **Streamlit Integration**: User-friendly deployment for real-time interaction and visualization.
- **Collaborative Outputs**: Agents work together to generate structured deliverables, such as README files or marketing strategies.

## Architecture
1. **Role Definition**: Assigns specific roles to agents for task specialization.
2. **Backstory Creation**: Provides agents with contextual understanding to improve performance.
3. **Task Assignment**: Allocates marketing-specific tasks to agents based on their roles.
4. **Crew AI Framework**: Manages agent collaboration and task orchestration.
5. **LLM Integration**: Uses groq/Ollama 3.1:8b to synthesize inputs and generate outputs.
6. **Streamlit Deployment**: Offers an interactive platform for configuration and monitoring.

## Workflow
1. Define roles and backstories for agents.
2. Assign tasks based on marketing goals.
3. Configure Crew AI to manage agents.
4. Integrate agents with the LLM for processing.
5. Deploy on Streamlit for user interaction.
6. Compile outputs into a structured README file or other deliverables.
